# Emotion Detection from Facial Images

This repository provides tools and models for detecting human emotions from facial images using classical machine learning (SVM) and deep learning (ONNX) techniques.

## üß† Models

### 1. SVM Models

- `emotion_svm_model.pkl`: May use raw or flattened image data.
- `emotion_svm_hog.pkl`: Uses extracted HOG features for training.

### 2. Deep Learning Model

- `emotion-ferplus-8.onnx`: A model trained on the FER+ dataset to detect 8 emotions:
  - Neutral
  - Happiness
  - Surprise
  - Sadness
  - Anger
  - Disgust
  - Fear
  - Contempt
